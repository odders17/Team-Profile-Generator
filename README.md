# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description

My task is to build a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, then generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. Testing is key to making code maintainable, so I also wrote a unit test for every part of your code and ensure that it passes each test.

## Motivation

To allow the developer more time problem solving and less time duplicating efforts, streamlining each step of the programming process it vital. One step in streamlining project development is by automating the process of creating README.md files.

## Learning Targets

This exercise was my first experience at writing tests.
